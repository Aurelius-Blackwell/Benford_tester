# Benford_tester
This collection of programs can be used to test whether a group of files (placed together in a folder) adhere to Benford's Law. It can be used to identify an outlier among the files, i.e. to demonstrate that the file does not follow a numerical distribution from natural exponential processes.
To prevent periods or commas causing a simple regex to read one number as multiple numbers, the massEditor program first removes all periods and commas from the data.
The firstDigitCounter program can then read from the transformed data and lists the percentage frequency of each digit as a first digit from each file. These are saved to the benfordTests_template.xlsx, a copy of which is in this repo. (Output is saved as benfordTests.xlsx.)
Finally, the benfordTest program performs a simple regression and adds the stats for each file to benfordTests.xlsx. The data in the Excel file could be transformed to be more suitable to a linear regression, but due to the small sample size and flattening of the curve, data which deviates from Benford's Law on 1 or 2 digits will generally still show a p-value of less than 0.05.
